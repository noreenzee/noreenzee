Hi, I’m @noreenzee.
I’m interested to learn new skills and knowledge to make myself up to date.
I did data analystic certification from University of Utah Bootcamp and worked on hands on projects along with my associate degree in computer science from Salt Lake Community College. I am attending Utah Valley University as a Student of Data Science. 
I’m looking to collaborate on github.
I can be reached on noreenzee/README.md
